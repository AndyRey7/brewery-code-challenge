## About
An app where the user can select from a list of breweries and see more information on the certain brewery that is clicked from the list on the left. This was one using the OpenBreweryDB API and then afterwards I implemented my own fetch API database with Ruby on Rails.

## Setup

To get you going, You would need to type these in your terminal:

1. In your terminal run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
2. Navigate to `brewery-backend` and run `rails s` from your terminal to get the backend up and running.
3. Navigate to `brewery-frontend` and run `npm start` or `yarn start` to get the front-end working and you're good to go try try out the app.


## Made Using:

* React
* Ruby on Rails
* SASS, CSS for styling
* OpenBreweryDB API
* GoogleMaps API
